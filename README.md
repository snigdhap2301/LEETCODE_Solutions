# LEETCODE_Solutions
This repository houses my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a widely acclaimed platform for honing one's technical coding skills, primarily in preparation for technical coding interviews. I leverage this repository to record my ongoing progress and developmental growth as a skilled developer.

# How to navigate this repository
Each problem has its own folder with the problem name, containing a README.md file with the problem description, and a solution file with my code in Python. The solution file is named using the problem number and a brief description of the problem.

# Why I am doing this
I am utilizing LeetCode as a means to enhance my problem-solving proficiency, coding dexterity, and to prepare for upcoming technical coding interviews. Through the process of solving these problems, I am able to broaden my understanding of various data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns. This affords me the opportunity to fortify my expertise in these areas, as well as to gain exposure to new concepts that I may have previously been unfamiliar with. By honing these critical skills, I am better equipped to tackle complex coding challenges with increased confidence and efficiency. Moreover, the practical experience and knowledge gained from LeetCode can translate into valuable assets that I can leverage throughout my career as a software developer.
