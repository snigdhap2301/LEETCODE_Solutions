we use "temp" (dictionary) called "temp" and loop through each element of the nums list using the "enumerate" function.
For each element, we calculate the complement "c" and check if it exists in the "temp".Otherwise , we add the current element and its index to the "temp".

#The code starts:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        temp = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            c = target - num
            if c in temp:
                return [temp[c], i]
            temp[num] = i
